{"content": "## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nUnit tests are designed to verify the smallest parts of an application, such as functions or classes, in isolation. In our project, unit tests are extensively used to ensure the correctness of individual components. We utilize the Rust testing framework, which is integrated into the language, to write and run these tests. Each module typically contains a corresponding test file where unit tests are defined. Best practices include writing tests for both typical and edge cases, ensuring that all possible inputs and outputs are covered.\n\n### Integration Tests\nIntegration tests focus on the interactions between different modules or components of the application. These tests are crucial for verifying that the modules work together as expected. In our project, integration tests are located in the `tests` directory and cover functionalities such as map importing, lane changing, and simulation processes. We use the `anyhow` crate for error handling in these tests, which helps in diagnosing failures more effectively.\n\n### End-to-End Tests\nEnd-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios to ensure that the entire application stack functions correctly. These tests are particularly important for verifying complex workflows, such as map editing and simulation runs. We aim to automate these tests as much as possible to facilitate regression testing. The `wasm-bindgen` tool is used for testing web-based components, ensuring that the user interface behaves as expected.\n\n### Test Coverage\nTest coverage is a metric used to measure the extent to which the source code is tested. We use tools like `tarpaulin` to generate coverage reports, which help identify untested parts of the codebase. Our goal is to maintain a high level of coverage, particularly for critical components like map modeling and simulation logic. Regular reviews of coverage reports are conducted to identify and address gaps.\n\n### Mocking Strategies\nMocking is used to simulate the behavior of complex objects that are not feasible to include in unit tests. We employ mocking strategies to isolate the code under test and to simulate interactions with external systems, such as file I/O and network requests. The `mockall` crate is used to create mock objects, allowing us to test components in isolation without relying on external dependencies.\n\n### Test Data Management\nTest data management is crucial for ensuring that tests are reliable and repeatable. We maintain a set of golden files that serve as the expected output for various test scenarios. These files are stored in a dedicated directory and are version-controlled to track changes over time. Additionally, we use factories and builders to generate test data dynamically, ensuring that tests remain flexible and maintainable.\n\n### Continuous Integration Testing\nContinuous Integration (CI) is an essential part of our development workflow. We use CI pipelines to automatically run tests on every commit, ensuring that new changes do not introduce regressions. Our CI setup includes running unit, integration, and end-to-end tests across multiple environments. We use GitHub Actions to manage our CI pipelines, which provide detailed feedback on test results and code quality metrics.\n\n### Best Practices\n- Write clear and concise test cases that focus on a single functionality.\n- Use descriptive names for test functions to indicate their purpose.\n- Regularly update and refactor tests to accommodate changes in the codebase.\n- Ensure tests are deterministic and do not rely on external state or timing.\n- Review test results and coverage reports regularly to maintain high code quality.", "cost": {"input_cost": 0.00758, "output_cost": 0.00999, "total_cost": 0.01757}, "tokens": {"input_tokens": 1516, "output_tokens": 666, "total_tokens": 2182}}
