{"content": "## Project Overview\n\n### Purpose and Goals\nThe Codebase Assistant (Codeas) is designed to enhance software development processes by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with the entire codebase as context. The primary goal of Codeas is to streamline tasks such as documentation generation, code refactoring, testing, and deployment strategy formulation. By integrating AI capabilities, Codeas aims to improve productivity, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistency across software projects.\n\n### Target Audience\nCodeas is targeted at software developers, project managers, and DevOps engineers who seek to optimize their workflow through automation and AI-driven insights. It is particularly beneficial for teams working on large codebases where maintaining documentation, testing, and deployment strategies can be challenging and time-consuming.\n\n### Key Features\n- **AI-Driven Documentation**: Automatically generate comprehensive documentation sections using OpenAI's language models.\n- **Refactoring Assistance**: Define refactoring groups and generate proposed changes with diffs to improve code quality.\n- **Testing Strategy Generation**: Develop testing strategies and generate tests based on repository metadata and guidelines.\n- **Deployment Strategy Formulation**: Create deployment strategies and generate Terraform code for AWS resources.\n- **Streamlit-Based UI**: User-friendly interfaces for managing various aspects of the codebase, including metadata and repository files.\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Programming Language**: Python (>=3.9, <3.12)\n- **Frameworks and Libraries**: \n  - Streamlit for building interactive UIs\n  - Pydantic for data validation\n  - OpenAI API for AI interactions\n  - Other dependencies include PyYAML, Python-dotenv, Pyperclip, and more as specified in `requirements.txt`\n- **Build and Linting Tools**: \n  - Setuptools for build system\n  - Black, Isort, and Ruff for code formatting and linting\n\n### System Architecture Overview\nCodeas is structured around a modular architecture that separates core functionalities into distinct components. The system leverages Streamlit for the UI layer, providing a seamless interface for user interactions. The core logic is encapsulated within Python modules that handle metadata management, context retrieval, and LLM interactions. The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations to efficiently process requests and generate outputs.\n\n### Repository Structure\n- **`src/codeas/ui`**: Contains UI components and pages built with Streamlit, including interfaces for documentation, refactoring, testing, and deployment.\n- **`src/codeas/core`**: Houses core functionalities such as metadata management, context retrieval, and LLM client interactions.\n- **`src/codeas/configs`**: Includes configuration files for prompts, agent settings, and LLM parameters.\n- **`src/codeas/use_cases`**: Defines specific use cases for documentation, deployment, refactoring, and testing.\n- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python package dependencies required for the project.\n- **`pyproject.toml`**: Configures the build system, project metadata, and linting settings.\n- **`Makefile`**: Provides targets for code formatting and linting.\n- **`README.md`**: Offers an introduction and detailed instructions for setting up and using Codeas.", "cost": {"input_cost": 0.007935, "output_cost": 0.009825, "total_cost": 0.01776}, "tokens": {"input_tokens": 1587, "output_tokens": 655, "total_tokens": 2242}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "# LICENSE [226 tokens]:\nThe given file is a license document that grants permission to use, modify, and distribute the software under the MIT License, while also disclaiming warranties and liabilities. \n\nTechnologies: None mentioned.\n\n# requirements.txt [95 tokens]:\nThe given file specifies a list of Python package dependencies required for a project, including their minimum versions or exact versions where applicable.
